  <p>“I have lost a total of 14 inches round my waist and dropped from an 18/20 to a 12/14” — Amrita Singh</p>
<p><img src="thumb-300.webp#nat" alt=""></p>
<p>I remember vividly after, our consultation where I had constant questions such as:</p>
<p>Would I be able to keep up?
Will it be hard?
Mike mentioned words such as “squats and lunges” and I remember recoiling back in horror at the very mention of them. Looking back now I know why these questions appeared. Personally, I was unhappy with my appearance and knew I couldn’t go alone in changing my situation.</p>
<p>The first success I achieved by signing up to Mike, was actually admitting that I needed help and being very clear in the results I wanted. Reflecting back on my first session and comparing it to my sessions after, I received all the answers to the questions I had at first. Loosing weight, I believe is a personal and at times a sensitive area.</p>
<p>During training Mike has never made me feel undermined or forced to do anything against my will. One of the reasons why I enjoy training with Mike is that he allows you to venture into new territory. I have used training methods that previously I was unaware of and now really enjoy doing.</p>
<p>His training allows you to pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses. Whilst exercising alone I turned a blind eye to my weaknesses. I am now finding myself wanting to overcome any weak areas, often practising at home to improve on them!</p>
<p>I have now dropped two dress sizes, and I am close to dropping my third. I am clear on my next set of targets and will continue training with Mike. I am much more confident in my appearance and now avoid hiding behind the “all black” outfit. Most importantly, my attitude not only towards training, but towards diet and lifestyle has completely changed.</p>
<p>Mike makes training enjoyable and hard work at the same time. When I leave each session, feeling the aches in either my legs or arms I have enough energy to grin and be proud of my efforts!</p>
<p>Results:
After 4 months — Lost 10 inches round my waist — Dropped from size 18/20 to 14/16</p>
<p>After 6 months — Lost 14 inches round my waist — Dropped form size 18/20 to 12/14</p>
