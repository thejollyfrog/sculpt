      <description>“I have lost a total of 14 inches round my waist and dropped from an 18/20 to a 12/14” — Amrita Singh
I remember vividly after, our consultation where I had constant questions such as:
Would I be able to keep up? Will it be hard? Mike mentioned words such as “squats and lunges” and I remember recoiling back in horror at the very mention of them. Looking back now I know why these questions appeared.</description>

      <description>“I have lost just over two stone so far” — Claudia Pearlman, Care Worker. I had been overweight for years and as confident as I came across to people that I was fine with how I looked, inside I was a mess. So when I met Mike in November 2008, I was very happy and ready for him to step in.
Straight away on the initial consultation with Mike I knew he was going to change my life and health for the better.</description>

      <description>“I lost a stone in the first week” — Dave Chadwick I came across Sculpt &amp;amp; Shape when I met Mike in the gym. I have been using the gym for many years, but only over the last 12 months has it become very important to me, as it helps me to focus and unwind after a day at work. I have had personal training before and had not been overly impressed.</description>

      <description>“I am leaner then I was ever before and I have lost over 18kg” — Dilip Vaghela
Over the years I have tried many diets and training programmes, which all ended up in me putting on more weight than I initially started with. This led to me to becoming demotivated and feeling unhappy in the way I looked.
In March 2008 I thought enough was enough and I decided that I was going to lose weight.</description>

      <description>“Over seven months I lost five stone, gained fitness and muscle tone, and totally transformed the way I think about food and eating.” — Fiona Allan, CEO, Birmingham Hippodrome
Mike Kirk changed my life. When I met him, I was an extremely unhealthy weight, totally unfit, and ate and drank whatever I liked whenever I liked. Comfort eating, snacking all day, alcohol every night, coffee to wake me up the next day: a cycle that had gone on for years.</description>

      <description>“I was shocked that I lost 1.5 stone in only 6 weeks” — Steve Dunkley I started training with Mike in October with an intention to lose my excess fat and gain muscle. He gave me all the advice I needed to change my diet and live a healthy active lifestyle. The information on his website was also a really useful resource and the recipes were great. I especially liked the smoothies as they were not only useful as a weight loss tool, but they tasted fantastic!</description>

      <description>“Even Though it has been 5 weeks with him, I have amazingly lost 1.5 Stone in weight” — Ed Rex Okay, like you, I was reading these testimonials and thinking what does this guy, Mike Kirk, have to offer me? Can Mike give me results? Can Mike help me stay in the results? Two words — HELL Yeah! I do admit that with some trepidation when I was meeting with him for my consultation that I thought he would be one of those personal trainers that are only after your money and give you a bog-standard fitness programme that’s not tailored to your needs.</description>

      <description>“I’ve lost almost 2 stone, in weight, and 6 inches from my waist.” — Neal Harris, NHS Manager. I’ve been training with Mike for six months and the physical results speak for themselves: I’ve lost almost 2 stone, in weight, and 6 inches from my waist. Sessions with Mike aren’t just about physical well-being, they’re about mental well-being too. My confidence levels have increased loads over the past few months.</description>
