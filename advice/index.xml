      <description>Credit where credit&amp;rsquo;s due. Many trainers (not all) that I have met have a good grasp on both fitness and weight training.
However, few have any understanding of the body, human dietary needs and the true reason we all aim to improve our bodies.
Note: though a number of trainers that I know are competent in the gym, many unsuspecting gym instructors and lifeguards have now been pressured into this role by health clubs and gyms in an attempt to squeeze more money from their members.</description>

      <description>You might think I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about sugar making you fat&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not!
Sugar (I mean refined sugar &amp;ndash; cane, palm, coconut, rice syrup, pasteurised fruit juice&amp;hellip;)
When I say &amp;lsquo;sugar&amp;rsquo; I am referring to any sugar which is no longer part of a living fruit or vegetable.
Why is sugar so bad?
Sugar causes deficiencies Stripped from its natural origin, sugar is void of the enzymes and nutrients necessary to break it down into glycogen and assimilate it.</description>

      <description>1/2 – 1 stone per month! Sound too good to be true? A 5 stone loss should be achieved in 5 to 10 months.
So why does weight loss seem so hard to achieve? Most people attempt to lose weight through calorie cutting/measuring and long duration exercise. Both are a complete waste of time.

      <description>Most of us like to be in good shape. However, few people are able to reach their ideal or even come close.
This is because we have been taught to think about food wrongly.
There are, likely, two main problems with your diet:
 You are addicted to certain foods Many of the foods you need to satisfy your body (and avoid deficiency) are missing or in short supply  There is no way to exercise away a poor diet.</description>
