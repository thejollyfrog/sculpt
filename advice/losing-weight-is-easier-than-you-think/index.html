  <p>1/2 – 1 stone per month! Sound too good to be true? A 5 stone loss should be achieved in 5 to 10 months.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-does-weight-loss-seem-so-hard-to-achieve">So why does weight loss seem so hard to achieve?</h2>
<p>Most people attempt to lose weight through calorie cutting/measuring and long duration exercise. Both are a complete waste of time. As your body will swiftly regulate its requirement, just as it does your requirement of oxygen (as you increase your aerobic fitness).</p>
<p>Instead, you need to understand the mechanism of which the body “chooses” to store fat — and simply reverse it.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-i-help-you-to-lose-weight">How will I help you to lose weight?</h2>
<p>I will discuss with you the science behind weight gain during your personal training sessions &ndash; this will cover, exactly how to eat and when and how long to train for rapid change and recovery.</p>
<p>Then, I will set you a plan which will likely incorporate daily exercise. This routine will be tailored to your abilities, and we will go through the details of how you can measure your progress between sessions.</p>
<p>Your sessions with me will incorporate measuring and monitoring of your progress since the last session and a workout — where I will check your technique and work with you to press forward.</p>
<p>You will be required to carry out everything that we have agreed (and take notes). Because of this, if you feel that you are not ready to make the necessary changes in your life, hold off and perhaps contact me when you are.</p>
<p>I have a “your result is my result” attitude and I will, therefore, give you all the support you need to reach your goals and beyond.</p>
<p>If you do feel ready to make those changes, contact me to set up your first session.</p>
